## Describe the problem
Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It involves the task of accurately identifying and classifying handwritten digits from images into their respective numerical representations (0 through 9).
The problem is typically approached as a supervised learning task, where a model is trained on a dataset containing labeled examples of handwritten digits. Each example consists of an image of a handwritten digit along with the corresponding label indicating which digit it represents.
## Programming language
This project at first is in need of the software of python. The packages have been imported and the algorithm created which is done by installing the new packages from online in python3.
Apart from that the total project is online compiled or ran and done by the software provided by the Google Colab free version and Jupyter Notebook.
## Datasets 
This project uses the MNIST dataset. This is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of the 10 digits, along with a test set of 10,000 images.

## Algorithm being applied / approach
The project will apply neural networks to recognize handwritten digits using one dataset from MNIST which is a widely used benchmark dataset
